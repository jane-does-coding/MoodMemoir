This website is just a funny way to let your friends or family know what mood you are in. Me and my friends use it to send reciepts after our hangouts to let each other know how it went for us.

One of the challenges I've faced while coding this was making the background of the receipt be aligned with the items on it, and also making it mobile responsive. Since with the absolute positioning, those parts were tricky.
